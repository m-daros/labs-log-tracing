# labs-log-tracing

The aims of this lab is to reason about complexity related to decomposition of  an application in small microservices having each one multiple instances, its own log files an every one interacting to one or more service in order to offer a functionality.

We address two concerns:

- **Logs aggregation**

  When an application is decomposed in small pieces and every service can have one or more instances how can we retrieve the necessary info on log files in order to debug a problem? Can we find the location of every log file, can we access every one and find what we're searching for? 

  Obviously not: we need a single well known place where all logs are collected and accessible and we also need a way to search the info we need.

  

- **Distributed Tracing**

  If our application is affected by poor throughput, all computations takes long time to complete, or everyting is fine but sometime something happens and we can observe performance degradation, how can we found where is the problem if the degraded use case is spanned across many and many microservices? Is there one of the pieces where we have a bottleneck? How can we found where a transaction is taking the majority of the computation time?



Our sample application is composed by one downstream microservice that call other two upstream microservices

- **downstream-service**
- **upstream-service1**
- **upstream-service2**



The downstream service exposes a REST endpoint [http://localhost:10090/customers-info/{customer-id}](http://localhost:10090/customers-info/{customer-id}) and retrieves info related to a Customer given the customer id

The needed info are retrieved calling the upstream services in order to retrieve info related to:

Customers [http://localhost:8080/customers/{customer-id}](http://localhost:8080/customers/{customer-id})

Customer addresses [http://localhost:9090/addresses/customer/{customer-id}](http://localhost:9090/addresses/customer/{customer-id})



The info are composed and returned to the client

The application is described in the following picture:

In our lab we can support both **logs aggregation** and **distributed tracing** using the **Elastic stack**

http://elastic.co as described in the following image



Related to logs aggregation perspective:

Logs are collected by Beats (FIlebeat in our case) on every microservice machine or container, elaborated by Logstash (Extract Transform Load), ingested into Elasticsearch and then managed on Kibana in order to search the needed informations collected into logs.



Related to distributed tracing:

The Elastic APM stack can get trace info on every microservice machine or container using APM agents and collect them in Elasticsearch through an APM server.

APM data dan be visualized in Kibana using dedicated APM dashboards.
